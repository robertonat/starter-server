# starter-server

I wasnt sure exactly what I needed to upload so I only uploaded the main files that were changed from the starter code. I did not upload the node modules files since I figured youd be looking mainly at our code and how we changed it compared to the original. 
------
I was able to overcome postsql needed a password by manually changing the file to trust. As such hopefully theres no change in the port or password compared to the original file and should set up like your machine was able to set up locally. Other than that everything should work with out issue. Thanks for the semester!
